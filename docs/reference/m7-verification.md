# M7 verification

Plan: [M7 plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-11-06-m7-factions.md). Design: [M7 design](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-06-m7-factions-design.md). Evidence: [M7 factions](m7-factions.md).

## Resume record

```text
Resume record (updated 2026-11-06, Task 2 done)
Branch / base commit / working-tree state: m7-factions at 8171d00; Task 2 changes uncommitted until the Task 2 commit
Last green task / next incomplete task: Task 2 (risk tests known red) / Task 3 (pure rename)
Changed paths since last commit: tools/zh_parity/parity.py, tools/zh_parity/analyze.py, tools/test_faction_guard.py, game/tests/test_factions.gd, game/tests/run_tests.gd, this file
Last command / cases / checks / failures / exit / marker: sh tools/run_tests.sh, 282 cases / 112,748 checks / 9 failures (all in test_factions.gd, known red until Tasks 5-6), exit 1; run_lint.sh and run_warnings.sh pass; test_faction_guard.py OK; analyze.py --self-test OK
Known red case or blocker: test_factions.gd F1-F4 (owners: Task 5 F1-F2, Task 6 F3-F4); the suite is red until then by plan
Approved decisions, pre-authorizations used, deferred gates: local commit per green task (milestone prompt)
Usage so far: not recorded
Next exact action: restart fresh session ("resume from prompt.txt"), Task 3. Task 3 needs fresh baseline traces ($d0) from the tree before Task 3; test_factions.gd red cases are expected in them.
```

## Pins at base

`TERMINAL_TICK` 8286, `TICK_LIMIT` 10800, `S1_CORE_SERIES` 3600881543542644697 (`test_skirmish_match.gd`); `PINNED` 6374674a4bdd4dfb (`test_state_hash.gd`); `FINAL_DIGEST` 234f0b14453bc6c6 and new `TEAM_CORE_SERIES` 1490497313643459296 (`test_team_match.gd`); `TEAM_TICK_CAP` 27000; netplay `match` 8242; BM6 18500 / 16000; stress ceilings `run_combat.gd:10`.

## Pin changes

| test | assertion | old → new | cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| test_map | MP5 presets count | 9 → 10 | Web preset added in `b60edca`; base `main` was red on this one check before M7 (Task 0) |
| test_team_match | TB4 `TEAM_CORE_SERIES` | new, 1490497313643459296 | Task 0 |

## Departures and deferrals

- Base suite was 277 cases / 112,748 checks / 1 failure (MP5 count, above), not the plan's 277 / 112,744 / 0.

## Base rows (tree: m7-factions, M7 Task 0 working tree, Apple M6, idle-ish)

- Suite: 278 cases / 112,742 checks / 0 failures, twice.
- `run_benchmark.sh` exit 1: `open` HEADLESS p95 1.96 / p99 2.244 (pass), `dense` HEADLESS p95 1.953 / p99 2.227 (pass); combat stress `open` p95 2.897 / p99 4.027 against budget 1.82 / 3.64 and ceiling 2.05 / 3.86: exceeded, run stops there so `dense` is not reported.
- `run_team_match.sh` exit 0: `TEAM TIMING` n 20425, p50 1.433, p95 3.196, p99 6.958, max 16.423 (budget 1.82 / 3.64: exceeded).
- bench runner combat: open p95 3.466 / p99 4.75; dense p95 3.838 / p99 5.668; contact 1.318 / 2.173; skirmish3v3 1.633 / 2.077 (single run, runner is noisier than `run_combat.gd`).

## Task 1 (performance time box)

- `run_combat.gd` now prints every layout and fails once at the end (`open` and `dense` both print).
- Profile (`run_profile.sh`, combat_open p95 ms): `step` 2.784, `step.combat_plan` 2.027, `combat.nearest` 1.288 (17.65 calls/tick), `step.advance` 0.652, `step.combat_fire` 0.375. `skirmish_match` p95: `step.combat_plan` 0.267, `combat.nearest` 0.106, `step.advance` 0.104; `step.ids`, rates and `combat.build_grid` are each under 0.035 ms mean.
- None of the plan's three candidates (`step.ids`, `step.rates`, `combat.build_grid`) targets the top zone (`combat_plan` / `combat.nearest`). The plan says: no candidate for the top zone means stop. Ruling: zero fixes kept, no trace risk taken.
- Stress rows at this tree: `open` p95 2.773 / p99 3.813, `dense` p95 3.113 / p99 4.774 (budget 1.82 / 3.64, ceilings open 2.05 / 3.86, dense 2.52 / 4.02): exceeded. `contact` 1.152 / 1.623 and `skirmish3v3` 1.379 / 1.635 inside budget. Team match `TEAM TIMING` p95 3.196 exceeded (Task 0 row).
- Gate-1 proposal: `combat.nearest` is the real cost; a speedup there is a candidate for a later user-approved time box, not trace-preserving by default. Stress ceilings stay.

## Values table

Cadence, measured (source build, `~/CnC/parity/traces`, 2026-11-06):

| scenario | metric | formula | measured | Wargrid uses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rof_rocket` | shot interval | 30 | 30 | 30 |
| `rof_scout` | shot interval | 6 | 6 | 6 |
| `burst_battery` | burst pattern | 8,8,8,60 | 0 shots in 600 frames | formula 8 / clip 4 / reload 60 (battery could not be measured; spawned without a power plant, so likely dark from the POWERED flag, not verified) |

Gate-1 rows (cost, ticks, max_hp, armor, vision, radius, weapon, other) are the plan's Task 2 table, unchanged: no measured gap, so formula delays stand. Armor percentages and footprints as in the plan's Task 2 tables.
