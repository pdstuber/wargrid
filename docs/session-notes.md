# Session notes

Working handoff record, not authoritative design. Follow [kickoff](kickoff.md) and [wrap-up](wrapup.md). Setup lives in [README](../README.md); design in [blueprint](../Wargrid_Kickoff_Blueprint.md).

## Session

2026-11-01: M0 local foundation built and verified. Remote CI gate pending. Kickoff/wrapup workflow ported from The Last Hearth; commands delegate to portable docs.

## Pending user action

- Approve or decline a push to run remote CI. Branch `m0-foundation` and first commit `Initialize Wargrid M0 foundation and session workflow` covering the 26 authored files are approved. Push/PR/merge are not approved; use Git status/log for current commit state.

## Deferred experiments and research

- Remote CI execution pending commit/push approval; not a passing gate.
- Visuals, game feel, performance, cross-platform determinism and Zero Hour parity unverified.
- Minor test coverage improvements deferred: pending-command tick/sequence sorting assertions and explicit normalized float-type assertions. See [M0 evidence](reference/m0-verification.md).
- M1 work waits for M0 exit gate and explicit scope; do not start automatically.

## Next action

Offer remote CI via separately approved push of `m0-foundation`; inspect remote configuration before proposing the exact command. Alternative: address deferred M0 test coverage first.

## 2026-11-01 — M0 local foundation

- [Execution plan](superpowers/plans/2026-11-01-m0-foundation.md) local checks complete; remote gate pending.
- [Verification record](reference/m0-verification.md) contains counts, failure probes, source provenance, review result and limits.
- Sole completed substantive review found no production defects; final Ponytail pass found no cuts. Grok attempt stalled, then fresh-context fallback completed.
- No engine upgrade, visible window, retail-data access, commit, push, PR or M1 work.

## 2026-11-01 — Session commands

- Added `.claude/commands/kickoff.md` and `.claude/commands/wrapup.md`, delegating to agent-neutral docs.
- Replaced Last Hearth paper-run/ruleset steps with Wargrid verification and document ownership. Existing task instructions override a redundant kickoff question.
- No checker script, game behavior or Git action added.

## 2026-11-01 — Wrap-up trial

- Fresh headless wrapper run: 11 cases / 199 checks / 0 failures, exit 0; final completion marker present. Old test agent retained restrictive sandbox and failed during import; fresh agent passed with current permissions. No game changes needed.
- Fixed stale planning-only status in AGENTS by linking README; blueprint local checkboxes now match evidence. Remote CI checkbox remains open. No design decision changed.
- Checked local documentation links/paths and handoff headings. Existing implementation reviews retained; no duplicate review.
- Proposed first commit includes initial user-authored planning/reference files, M0 implementation and session commands. No staging, branch creation or commit before approval. `.godot` cache ignored; scratch evidence stays outside repo. No active Wargrid background process found.
- Process deviations retained: grouped acceptance red/green cycle; stalled Grok attempt replaced by sole completed fresh-context review. Optional coverage gaps stay deferred.

## 2026-11-01 — First-commit approval

- User explicitly approved branch `m0-foundation` and first commit `Initialize Wargrid M0 foundation and session workflow`, covering all 26 authored files.
- Approval includes planning/reference documentation, M0 implementation/tooling/CI and session workflow. Cache and temporary evidence excluded.
- No push, PR or merge authorized. Next gate is remote CI after separate push approval.
